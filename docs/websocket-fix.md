# WebSocket Integration Fixes

## Problem Resolved
Fixed the 404 error for WebSocket polling requests by addressing the path mismatch between the Chrome extension and the Next.js Socket.IO server.

## Changes Made

### Server-Side Changes:
1. **Enhanced Socket.IO Server Configuration**
   - Added proper CORS handling to accept connections from Chrome extension
   - Ensured path is consistently set to `/api/websocket`

2. **Created WebSocket Status Endpoint**
   - Added new API endpoint at `/api/websocket-status` for connection testing
   - Allows the extension to check server availability before attempting Socket.IO connection

### Chrome Extension Changes:
1. **Migrated from Native WebSocket to Socket.IO**
   - Updated background.js to use Socket.IO instead of native WebSockets
   - Added Socket.IO client loading in background.html
   - Improved error handling and reconnection logic

2. **Enhanced UI and Error Reporting**
   - Added error details display in the extension popup
   - Implemented troubleshooting tips button
   - Improved connection status indicators

3. **Better Connection Testing**
   - Added server availability check before attempting connection
   - Implemented fallback from websocket to polling transport

### Documentation:
1. **Added Troubleshooting Guide**
   - Created `/docs/websocket-troubleshooting.md` with common issues and solutions
   - Added in-extension troubleshooting tips

## How It Works Now
1. The Chrome extension first checks if the WebSocket server is available using the `/api/websocket-status` endpoint
2. If available, it establishes a Socket.IO connection using the same path as the server (`/api/websocket`)
3. Socket.IO will attempt to use WebSocket first, and fall back to polling if necessary
4. Connection errors are displayed in the extension popup with details to help diagnose issues

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Start the Next.js development server: `npm run dev`
2. Load the Chrome extension
3. Connect to a Google Meet call
4. Check the extension popup for connection status
5. Monitor the browser console and Next.js server logs for connection events
